## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

In this challenge i learned how customize the markers (i really spent some time searching how to do this XD), and trained my css and semantic html (I tried at least).

```css
.recipe-box ol ::marker {
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my responsive css, because I still have some difficulties with this.

### Useful resources

- [Customize Markers on ol](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_marker.php) - This helped me with the issue of customizing the markers. This really helped me a lot.
